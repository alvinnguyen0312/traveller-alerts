# traveller-alerts

## what it is
A small app that allows travellers to create and search for travel advisories
## what it does
 - User can add a new travel alert
 - User can search for travel alerts by traveller's name, region or sub-region

## what I used to build it
- Front-end: using React and Material-UI
- Back-end: node.js, MongoDB for storing data after retrieving from external data source (JSON), GraphQL for data queries
